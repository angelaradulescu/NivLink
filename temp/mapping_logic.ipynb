Take a look at lines 681-724 to see how the mapping happens for the feature-wise AOI (don't judge the MATLAB code :). Here, for each event that fell inside the AOIs, we're looping through 9 AOIs and asking whether the location of the eye position during that event fell in that AOI. If so, we use the Features matrix computed above to assign the correct Feature and Dimension to that event. "
